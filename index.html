                    <p>I'm a user experience designer, with former background in cognitive science and medicine. My passion lies in working with real users in real world environment. I have worked extensively with the extreme users (Neuroscientists and medical doctors) to understand their design needs and to come up with effective design solutions for their problems. My aim is to create useful design solutions for users by gathering user needs, through creating personas, storyboards and applying user centred design and grounded theory approaches</p>
